AGENDA


@all:

- each student: report current state & issues/questions
    * Changbin: 
        - hyperparam order for all folds & mean/std of validBAC for all hyperparam
        - training dynmics examples 
    * Heiner: 
        - data loader
    * Alessandro:
        - adoption of data loader
        
- ensure: materials in meetings folder and repo up2date?

- code sharing: data loader & accuracy calculation? [note if skip>1 convnet needs to be recalculated]

- computation time optimization
    - new subsampling (scenes + CV folds) scheme
    - Alessandro: skip > 1

- early stopping

- models saving: at last "good" epoch & validBAC save (use that for the subsequent folds) & store the finally chosen epoch number for later!

    
- BAC & BAC2 => save sensitivity & specificity (not only BAC as it does not allow BAC2 calculation)

- next meetings: 
    - all: in three weeks = Mon 16th July 15:30 (with Changbin via Skype)
    - Heiner/Alessandro => at least once in between / make appointment
    
- availability: holidays/treatment of each, plan to submit
    - Moritz: 22th July - 5th August, 17th - 27th October
    - Ivo: 
    - Heiner: 
    - Alessandro: 
    - Changbin: 


    
@Changbin: 

- gridlstm 
    * which implementation used? hopefully following:  tf.contrib.rnn.GridLSTMCell
    * share_time_frequency_weights = true !!
    * with which features to start?
    * examples: 
        - Li et al 2017 (Google Home): feature_dim=128(?), stride=16, filtersize=16 (=> non-overlapping)
        - Sainath et al 2016:, feature_dim=128, stride=4, filter size=24 

- supervision from remote

- thesis submission: 31th Oct?


    
@Alessandro:

- separation between B.S. thesis & NI project? 
    => order & content expectation [we can provide]
    => thesis & project due dates

    

@Heiner:
- check prioritization of contents

- project submission date: end of Sept?

- expectations
