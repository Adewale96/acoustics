AGENDA:

* lead: Ivo and Moritz same responsibility for all students and theses


* discussion speed slower (s.t. everyone can follow): please ask questions/do not interrupt (particularly Ivo/Heiner/Moritz) => efficiency/fairness


* server availability: 1-2 titan x (first 1) on eltanin see slack; nvidia-smi for occupancy


* current situation with data/models: 

=> Heiner: data export status (where?)

=> Ivo: label situation: 2 data sets, start with difficult one (instant labels), continue with easier one (block-based) for which we have a reference accuracies

=> current status of each implementation

=> questions/discussion?


* initial distribution of topics, first only technical/model centered:

=> Changbin hyperparameter optimization, learning and architecture [depth/hierarchical layer size/later: conv layer])

=> Heiner: advanced regularization techniques: dropout/variational dropout/layer normalization/batch normalization [first implement independent from Changbin running LSTM model then sync/discuss and then explore the regularization] -- potentially later attention

=> Alessandro: convnet & dropout on fc layers

=> use simple data set once available

=> own topics: suggests welcome!


* Alessandro: let's meet also with Youssef? maybe he gives small presentation?


* next meeting: Heiner two weeks gone... meet before to clarify everything (and individual meetings with Changbin or Alessandro afterwards)
