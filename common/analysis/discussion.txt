- clarify/decide: should we better include nSrc=1 in the nSrc-averaged as we optimize for the balance between all classes via cross entropy and balanced accuracy? currently only nSrc=2,3,4 are included

- from 3 bestepochs to one final number of epochs => _individual looking at curves_? _median_, max? mean?

- alessandro's project => afterwards shortly?

next steps:
- final model training of version without weighting
- validation of best combiantion new weighting (for bestepoch) 
- final model training & evaluation update
- reproduction of changbin's results -- 
    => best combination: first validate then final model training (using bestepoch) 
    => first block complete
    => afterwards instant labels
- hist/batchlength=1s=1000
- instant labels (both 1s and 10s): first validation of the (for blockbased 10s) best combination for bestepochs
    
- what models to run with what priority?
