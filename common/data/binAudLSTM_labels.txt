 Labels
========


There exist two variants of labels; cf. label_methods.jpg. Both provide one label for each frame of each scene-instance for each class.


Heiner: added in brackets the respective labels after conversion (changed due to easier computation of binary cross entropy)

Heiner: LABEL order

['alarm', 'baby', 'femaleSpeech',  'fire', 'crash', 'dog', 'engine', 'footsteps', 'knock', 'phone', 'piano', 'maleSpeech', 'femaleScreammaleScream']

 Instant-labels
----------------
Matlab (Python)
+1 (+1)		: the respective sound event is active only on the master source in this frame.
-1 (0)		: the respective sound event is not active on any source in this frame.
NaN: the respective sound event is active on at least one source different than the master source in this frame.

Recommendation: treat NaN as +1 in training, and assign NaN frames zero cost in testing (for easier acoustic interpretation of the results).

Heiner: to fulfill recommendation:
change nan to +1 in train and to -1 in testing

 BlockInterprete-labels
------------------------
Matlab (Python)
+1 (+1)		: the respective sound event has been active only on the master source during the last 500 ms to an extent of at least 75%.
-1 (0)		: the respective sound event has not been active on any source during the last 500 ms.
0 (-1)		: the respective sound event has been active only on the master source during the last 500 ms to an extent below 75%.
NaN: the respective sound event has been active on at least one source different than the master source during the last 500 ms.

Recommendation: treat NaN as +1 in training, and assign NaN frames zero cost in testing (for easier acoustic interpretation of the results). Assign 0 (-1) frames zero cost in training and testing (ground truth is unclear).

Heiner: to fulfill recommendation:
change nan to +1 in train and to -1 in testing

If the recommendation is met, the blockinterprete-label results will be completely comparable to the block-based logistic regression (or svm) models' results.
