Use get_lstm_cache_path in python like:

>>> import matlab.engine
>>> eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()
>>> path = eng.get_lstm_cache_path( 'train', 'features', 4, 80, 13 )
>>> path
'/mnt/raid/data/ni/twoears/reposX/idPipeCache/FeatureSet5aRawTimeSeries/cache.mc4_train__scene80_fold4'

with syntax get_lstm_cache_path( <TRAINORTEST>, <STAGE>, <FOLD>, <SCENE>, <CLASS> ), where
TRAINORTEST is 'train' or 'test'
STAGE is 'dnn_labels', 'labels', 'features', or 'earsignals'
FOLD is between 1 and 6 for training and 7 or 8 for testing
SCENE is between 1 and 80 for training and between 1 and 126 for testing
CLASS is between 1 and 13 (only relevant for labels)
