# input standardization on full training set works? applied on test set, too? => Heiner

# apply a saved model that was trained on the full training set with the earlystopping (optimnal w.r.t. average across three or even better all six validation folds)

# TODO: ignore the wbac value (since averaging over scenes might not be useful), though Heiner used the correct test scene weights
