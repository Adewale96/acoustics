AGENDA

participants: Moritz, Ivo, Youssef, Heiner, Changbin, Alessandro

* greeting & welcome round (Moritz)

* github/folder structure (Moritz)
- https://github.com/nigroup/binaural_audition
- work in python/tensorflow (only presentations in jupyter notebooks)

* block-wise classification results (Ivo)
- put slides as pdf to github or send by mail

* new data situation & specification (Ivo)
- update online text files for missing information & move into 

* student cluster: Heiner, Changbin, Alessandro, (from May on also: Siddharth)
- arrange regularly (weekly) cluster meeting, e.g. work at HiWi dungeion and meet in library
- try to clarify all questions within cluster first
- collect unanswered questions for next meeting with supervisors and prepare questions with precise documentation/plots/outputs

* data visualization (Moritz) => Changbin/Alessandro

* data format optimization (Moritz) => Heiner

* meetings/presentations
- typically: every 1-3 weeks (e.g. 2-3 on average) with prepared jupyter notebooks
- jupyter notebook and pdf file

* next date for meeting, topics: 
- data visualization
- optimized data format
- journal club

* next papers (suggestions): 
ARCHITECTURE/COST FUNCTIONS
- one multilabel classifier vs multiple binary classifiers
BEST PRACTICE
- dcase2016 papers and similar (convnet)
- dcase2016 papers and similar (lstm)
REGULARIZATION
- dropout with lstm
- batch normalization with mlp
- batch normalization with lstm

* GPU vs CPU timings (Heiner)

* convnet for ratemaps and amplitude modulation spectra (Youssef) => optional

* closure of project meeting -- journal club follows (Moritz):
- suggestion: arrange date within student cluster, especially in beginning (data questions) important

* lstm paper read (Moritz) => Florian et al holen

* toy LSTM implementations (Changbin)
