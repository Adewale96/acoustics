 Labels
========


There exist two variants of labels; cf. label_methods.jpg. Both provide one label for each frame of each scene-instance for each class.


 Instant-labels
----------------
+1: the respective sound event is active only on the master source in this frame.
-1: the respective sound event is not active on any source in this frame.
NaN: the respective sound event is active on at least one source different than the master source in this frame.

Recommendation: treat NaN as +1 in training, and assign NaN frames zero cost in testing (for easier acoustic interpretation of the results).

 BlockInterprete-labels
------------------------
+1: the respective sound event has been active only on the master source during the last 500 ms to an extent of at least 75%.
-1: the respective sound event has not been active on any source during the last 500 ms.
0: the respective sound event has been active only on the master source during the last 500 ms to an extent below 75%.
NaN: the respective sound event has been active on at least one source different than the master source during the last 500 ms.

Recommendation: treat NaN as +1 in training, and assign NaN frames zero cost in testing (for easier acoustic interpretation of the results). Assign 0 frames zero cost in training and testing (ground truth is unclear).

If the recommendation is met, the blockinterprete-label results will be completely comparable to the block-based logistic regression (or svm) models' results.
